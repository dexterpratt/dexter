# Welcome to My Blog

Welcome to my personal blog where I'll be sharing thoughts on AI, bioinformatics, software development, and the journey of scientific discovery.

## Why Start a Blog Now?

After decades in the field—from the early days of Lisp Machines and the Cyc project at MCC, through building causal reasoning systems at Genstruct, to creating the NDEx network commons—I've accumulated perspectives on the evolution of AI and computational biology that I'd like to share.

Now, as I pursue a late-career doctorate while developing AI co-scientist systems, it feels like the right time to document these experiences and ideas.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **AI and Scientific Discovery**: Reflections on building AI systems that can assist with or autonomously conduct research in molecular biology and drug discovery
- **Network Biology**: Lessons from over a decade of building tools like NDEx and Cytoscape for the biological research community
- **The Journey**: Personal reflections on transitioning from software leadership to graduate student, and the unique perspective that brings
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Occasional explorations of specific technical challenges and solutions

## Stay Connected

Feel free to reach out through the contact links on this site. I'm always interested in connecting with others working at the intersection of AI and biology.

More posts coming soon!
