# Principal Investigator, NDEx Project

**Ideker Lab, UCSD | 2013 - Present**

I created and serve as Principal Investigator for "The Network Data Exchange: a Network Commons for Biologists"—a platform that has become essential infrastructure for the biological network research community.

## What is NDEx?

NDEx (ndexbio.org) provides a cloud-based platform for storing, sharing, and publishing biological networks. It serves as the backend for the Cytoscape ecosystem of tools, enabling researchers worldwide to:

- **Store** their network data in a central, accessible location
- **Share** networks with collaborators or the public
- **Publish** networks alongside papers, making research reproducible
- **Search** across thousands of public biological networks

## Impact

NDEx has become a critical piece of infrastructure for network biology, supporting:

- Thousands of researchers worldwide
- Integration with major databases and tools
- Publication of networks from high-profile research papers
- Educational use in bioinformatics courses

## The Journey

Building NDEx has been a lesson in creating sustainable research infrastructure. Unlike typical research projects with defined endpoints, NDEx requires ongoing development, maintenance, and community engagement. It's taught me valuable lessons about:

- Building software that serves a diverse user community
- Balancing innovation with stability
- Sustaining open-source projects in academic settings
- The importance of interoperability and standards

The project continues to evolve, with ongoing work to improve search capabilities, support new data formats, and integrate with emerging tools and databases.
