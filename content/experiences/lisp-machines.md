# Director, User Interface Group

**Lisp Machine Inc. (LMI) | 1981 - 1986**

LMI produced advanced research workstation computers for artificial intelligence. These Lisp Machines ran a Lisp-based operating system and development environment that emerged from the MIT AI Lab—representing the cutting edge of computing at the time.

## The Technology

Lisp Machines were remarkable for their era:

- **Hardware optimized for Lisp**: Custom processors designed specifically to run Lisp efficiently
- **Integrated development environment**: The operating system itself was written in Lisp and fully introspectable
- **Advanced user interfaces**: Windowing systems, mouse-driven interaction, and sophisticated graphics years before these became mainstream

## My Role

As Director of the User Interface Group, I managed both production and software development groups. My responsibilities included:

- Designing hardware and software components
- Managing development teams
- Involvement in marketing and company planning
- Building the tools that researchers used to develop AI systems

## Formative Experience

Working at LMI during the early 1980s provided a unique perspective on computing. The Lisp Machine community pioneered many concepts—interactive development, self-documenting systems, powerful debuggers—that remain relevant today.

This experience shaped my approach to software development and gave me an appreciation for tools that empower developers. It also provided early exposure to the AI research community, connections that would prove valuable throughout my career.
