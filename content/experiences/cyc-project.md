# Senior Scientist, Cyc Project

**MCC (Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation) | 1989 - 1995**

Cyc was one of the most ambitious artificial intelligence projects ever undertaken—an attempt to build a comprehensive commonsense reasoning system based on symbolic AI and a massive hand-coded knowledge base.

## The Vision

The fundamental premise of Cyc was that true artificial intelligence requires a foundation of commonsense knowledge—the millions of facts and rules that humans take for granted but that are essential for understanding language, making inferences, and reasoning about the world.

## My Role

As a Senior Scientist on the project, I worked on:

- **Knowledge representation**: Developing formal representations for commonsense concepts and relationships
- **Inference mechanisms**: Building and optimizing reasoning engines that could work with the large knowledge base
- **Knowledge entry**: Contributing to the massive effort of encoding human knowledge into a form computers could use

## Lessons Learned

Working on Cyc provided invaluable insights into both the power and limitations of symbolic AI approaches. The experience shaped my thinking about knowledge representation and reasoning systems—lessons that proved relevant decades later when working on biological pathway analysis and, now, with modern AI systems.

The project taught me that capturing human knowledge is far more complex than it might appear, and that the interplay between structured knowledge and flexible reasoning remains one of the central challenges in AI.
