# Vice President, Innovation and Knowledge

**Genstruct Inc. (later Selventa) | 2002 - 2011**

At Genstruct, I played a central role in developing the company's technology and methodology for computational biology, designing and building core causal reasoning algorithms that transformed how pharmaceutical companies analyzed experimental data.

## Building the Technology

I designed and built the initial versions of many of Genstruct's core causal reasoning algorithms. These systems could analyze microarray experimental data and identify potential causal mechanisms underlying observed gene expression changes.

## Leading Consulting Engagements

Beyond technology development, I led teams of biologists on major consulting engagements with pharmaceutical companies. These projects involved:

- Analyzing large-scale gene expression datasets
- Identifying potential drug targets and mechanisms
- Building causal models of disease processes
- Translating computational findings into actionable biological hypotheses

## Impact

The work at Genstruct represented an early example of applying systematic computational approaches to drug discovery. The causal reasoning methods we developed helped establish computational biology as a valuable tool for pharmaceutical research.

This experience bridging software development and biological analysis laid the groundwork for my later work on network biology tools at UCSD.
